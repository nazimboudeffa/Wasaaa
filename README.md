# Wasaaa

Wasaaa is a plugin for YouPHPTube to let you access your videos stored on Wasabi.com

## Usage

I don't know why the other regions are not working actually, so it seems that if you have to create your buckets in *us-west-1* and let the REGION option as is, it works, and it works the same way for any other REGION just by letting the option as in the plugin. If you have any idea about this feature please let me know

## About

Wasaaa is free like in **free beer** or [name your own price](https://gum.co/lpwZh)
