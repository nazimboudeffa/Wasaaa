# Wasaaa

Wasaaa is a plugin for YouPHPTube to let you access your videos stored on Wasabi

## Usage

I don't know why the other regions are not working actually, so it seems that you have to create your buckets in *us-west-1* and let the REGION option as is. If you have any idea about this feature please let me know

## About

Wasaaa is free like in **free beer**
